# Embedded Machine Learning

This project is about running ML models on a microcontroller, in this case, the ESP32. 
The ML model is a simple sin predictor.Â 
The programme generates random numbers, predicts the sin using the ML model, and prints it to the serial monitor.

## Technology used:
- C++
- Python
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- TensorFlow Lite


## Build Guide

First, train the model.For this, you need [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and [python](https://www.python.org/) installed.
Then run the Jupyter notebook "Train Model.ipynb".
After training the model, you need to convert it to TFlite format so it can run on a microcontroller.
Since the ESP32 doesn't have a filesystem by default, the tflite file needs to be converted to a char array. 
You can achieve this by running this command.
```
xxd -i converted_model.tflite > model_data.cc
```
Generating The model is now complete.

Next, build and upload the code to the microcontroller. For this, I used the VS code extension [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
